bubble sort compares the 1st element with the second element,
 check if the 2nd one is better,
  if yes keep as it is ,
  if no...
  swap them
  now do the same comparison with second & third...if 2nd is better than 3rd-> swap them.....
  till the n-1 position....
  
  now @ the end of first loop completion the largest number will  be @ right side nth position....
  & @ the end of 2nd iteration 2nd largest will be on n-1 position....
  
  
  this phenomena happen in case of liquid bubbles... i.e - the largest bubble get over the small bubble..
  so if u imagine the unsorted array horizontally the largest no. is coming on top & then the second largest number...
  
  that's why it is called bubble sort.
